Description: KEGGGraph is an interface between KEGG pathway and graph
        object as well as a collection of tools to analyze, dissect and
        visualize these graphs. It parses the regularly updated KGML
        (KEGG XML) files into graph models maintaining all essential
        pathway attributes. The package offers functionalities
        including parsing, graph operation, visualization and etc.
